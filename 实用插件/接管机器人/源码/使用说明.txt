Usage

Players may use sm_pickbot (!pickbot) to make a menu appear and show available bots and their health, and offer an option to takeover one of the bot.

Alternatively, idle players may press the right mouse button to change the bot they are idling.

Finally, players may use sm_nextbot (!nextbot) and sm_prevbot (!prevbot) to quickly go through the available bots.
